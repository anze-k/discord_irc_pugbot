# Discord - irc pugbot

This is PUGBOT for pickup games which processing multiple message sources (IRC, Discord) build on node.js technology. **The project is still in development**.

Bot is inspired by old mIRC script mostly used for UT99 games: https://github.com/spydeee/PugBot - it implements most of its features and more.

## Configuration

Basic configuration entries are specified in **config.json** in [json format](https://www.json.org/). When the bot starts, it creates **config_live.json** and copies some configurations (like text commands) which are configurable trough bot commands.

The sample configuration is in **config_sample.json** - just copy and modify:

* **ident** - bot identification. Keep one permanent id for one bot application.
* **nickname** - bot nickname on IRC.
* **server** - IRC server.
* **discordToken** - Discord bot application token (described below).
* **discordClientId** - Discord bot application client id (described below).
* **channels** - Set of channel configuration where the bot is present. One of *channelDiscord* or *channelIrc* or both must be set per each key. Example:

<pre>
channels: {
    'default' : {
        'channelDiscord' : '123456',
        'channelIrc' : '#first'
    },
    'second' : {
        'channelDiscord' : '778899',
        'channelIrc' : '#second'
    },
    'another' : {
        'channelIrc' : '#third'
    }
}
</pre>

* **channelDiscord** - bot channel id (described below) *(old configuration)*
* **channelIrc** - channel on IRC. *(old configuration)*
* **discordDisable** - set true to disable bot on Discord.
* **ircDisable** - set true to disable bot on IRC (one message source must remain enabled).
* **ircAuthName** - IRC authentification user (uses AUTH command and PRIVMSG Q@CServe.quakenet.org for quakenet).
* **ircAuthPassword** - IRC authentification password.
* **ircMode** - additional IRC mode.
* **ircFloodDelay** - minimum delay between two messages sent to irc (in msecs).
* **ircAuthUsersOnly** - allow specific actions to authed users only like .join (discord id or irc auth).
* **format** - variable formatting of cross messages.
* **textCommands** - predefined text commands (each command must be defined as array of strings).
* **authUsers** - users and they auth levels (Discord ids, IRC auths or IRC hosts).

When bot starts it also creates **persistent.json** file, which contains current state.

## Installation

The bot requires [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) of version at least v6.14.

Follow these steps:


* fetch this git branch to some directory
* enter that directory
* run **npm update**
* set the configuration configuration (described above)
* run **./build_run.sh &**

May check **log.txt** for errors. If bot does not work, kill that process and run **./build_run_debug.sh** to see the verbose output.

## Setting up Discord bot

## How to BAN users

There are more possibilities, how to ban players. The ban command format is:

```
!ban [playername|key] [reason:specified reason] [dur:ban duration in hours] [mask:irc host mask as regex]
```

If the player does not exist, you must specify ban mask for the hostname. Otherwise, it bans specific player by ID on Discord or by AUTH on IRC. If you don't specify a duration, then the ban is permanent.

### BAN examples:

On Discord you simply ban player:

```
!ban player duration:24
!ban discord:player duration:24
!ban discord_id:123456 duration:24
```

On IRC you may ban specific player - but the player **must** be online and **authed**:

```
!ban irc_player
```

Otherwise, you must specify regexp masks (make sure you have correctly escaped mask):

```
!ban some_player duration:24 mask:player\.users.*
```

Or specify more masks:

```
!ban some_player duration:24 reason:denied mask:player\.users.* mask:smt\.net\.dk.*
```

When you want update ban, type !bandef command:

```
!bandef some_player
```

It shows ban command with all parameters to further updates.
